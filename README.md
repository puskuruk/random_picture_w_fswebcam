# random_picture_w_fswebcam

## Why?
I'm not best about making memories and I always working with my computer because of these I created this script for automatic generate memories for me.

## How?
### Installation?
1. Install fswebcam.
  >* I use Arch GNU/Linux and I installed with ```yay -S fswebcam``` . If you don't use Arch or Arch based distro you can search with "duckduckgo.com" how can you install for your distro.
2. Clone the repo.
3. ```cd where_your_repo```
4. ```chmod +x ./random_pic.sh```
5. ```./random_pic.sh```

## Tips?
I created an alias in $HOME/.zshrc for this script:
```bash
alias rndpic="$HOME/bash_scripts/random_pic.sh"
```
